## Inspiration
A lot of people know of carbon emissions and greenhouse gases but don't know if they have a bad carbon footprint and how to even improve it. This inspired me to create CarbonCheck. 
## What it does
It explains what a carbon footprint is and what the causes of a bad carbon footprint are. It also lets the user select answers and then get their carbon footprint evaluated by AI. 
## How we built it
I built it using Django, HTML, CSS, and the OpenAI API. I also used Figma to design the UI of the website before coding anything. 
## Challenges we ran into
I stood up for 24 hours and felt very tired and loopy. I ran into issues using the OpenAI API since it was my second time using it. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud that I was able to finish this in such a little amount of time. I had to get a blood test and built furniture over the weekend so I was left with only around 4 hours left. 
## What we learned
I learned how to use OpenAI API better. I learned how to adjust the temperature option. 
## What's next for CarbonCheck
I want to improve it so that it has more accurate evaluations. I would add more questions for users to answer.
