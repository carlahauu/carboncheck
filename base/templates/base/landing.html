  <h3>What is a carbon footprint?</h3>
  <p>A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions. Our carbon footprint has a negative impact on the environment in multiple ways: It is the main cause of human-induced climate change, it contributes to urban air pollution, it leads to toxic acid rain, it adds to coastal and ocean acidification, and it worsens the melting of glaciers and polar ice.
